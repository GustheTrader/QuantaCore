# 🌌 QuantaAI Agents: Sovereign Polymath OS

**QuantaAI** is a high-performance, private-first intelligence system designed to serve as a decentralized "Subject Matter Expert" (SME) orchestration layer. Built on the **FPT-Omega** (First Principles Thinking) framework, it allows operators to manage complex life, business, and trading architectures through a suite of specialized neural cores.

## 🛰️ Tracks & Neural Architecture

QuantaAI operates across three distinct logic tracks, each housing a suite of specialized SMEs:

### 1. 👤 Personal Track
Designed for holistic life optimization.

### 2. 💼 Business Track
Designed for executive orchestration and scale.

### 3. 📈 Trading & Investing Track
A specialized derivative deconstruction suite for market analysis.

## 🚀 Hybrid Inference Engine (New)

QuantaAI now supports **Multi-Source Compute** for the perfect balance of reasoning, speed, and privacy:

*   **Deep Reasoning (Gemini 3 Pro)**: Default engine for complex SME Council debates and search-grounded research.
*   **Hyper-Speed (Groq API)**: Near-instantaneous inference using Llama-3.3-70b and Mixtral. Ideal for rapid brainstorming.
*   **Sovereign Local (Ollama/LM Studio)**: Routes all inference to your local machine (localhost). Zero data leaves your network—perfect for proprietary business IP and private trade strategies.

## 💎 Key Features

*   **FPT-Omega Logic:** Every response is filtered through First Principles Thinking—stripping analogies to find non-negotiable atomic truths.
*   **Compute Toggling:** Switch engines mid-conversation based on the task complexity.
*   **Total Data Sovereignty:** Local-first memory persistence with optional Supabase encryption.
*   **Live Voice Sync:** Low-latency vocal links using raw PCM audio streaming.
*   **Neural Audits:** Trace agent axioms and reconstruction logic in the Council section.
